# Condensed Project Overview:

We made a meme creator. With the rise of internet, memes have become popular and we wanted to provide a way for a user to upload an image of their choice, customize with text, and get a meme which they can download. 

# My Feature:

The feature is a login and sign up page that works with a data table.

# Part A: Program Code
should specific images of code by added for all?

| Collegeboard Requirements | Me |
|------------------|------------------|
| Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online datas stream, a file.  | Our meme creator can take an image you upload, as well as top and bottom text that you can input, to create a meme.  |
| Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collectino of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose.  | An example of a collection of data that is stored is the database of memes on the backend that gets updated when a new memes is made. It helps contribute to our program's purpose because we use the data of all of these memes on the gallery page so users can download them.|
| At least one procedure that contirubted to the program's intended purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters:  | This procedure has a name(post), a return(response), and parameters(self): <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gjL8Vg7/Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-9-53-31-PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-9-53-31-PM" border="0"></a>  |
| An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure  | This function shows the sequencing, selection, and iteration through a list of meme images: <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/T8d1BvX/Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-10-01-23-PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-10-01-23-PM" border="0"></a>  |
| Calls to your student-developed prodcedure:  | calling queryImages:<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bNbXZN7/Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-10-04-52-PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-10-04-52-PM" border="0"></a>  |
| Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or ) based on input and program functionality  | This code is the fetch that displays the image based off the users inputted image and top+bottom text: <a href="https://ibb.co/9WxPg5Q"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/dDNZMY8/Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-10-07-58-PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-10-07-58-PM" border="0"></a>

# Learning Journey
In preparation for the Collegeboard Practice MC, I dedicated my study efforts to the team teaching topics covered throughout this trimester. These topics spanned a range of subjects, including The Internet, Routing, Computing, Beneficial and Harmful Effects, Digital Divide, Computing Bias, Undecided Problems, Crowdsourcing, Legal and Ethical Concerns, and Safe Computing.

To thoroughly prepare, I diligently reviewed the team teach lessons provided for each of these topics. I went through the popcorn hacks, ensuring a comprehensive understanding, and meticulously read all the relevant information provided. Additionally, I revisited the homework assignments associated with these subjects, double-checking my grasp of the material to ensure I was fully prepared.

After investing considerable time in review, I felt confident in my readiness and proceeded to take the MC test. This focused approach to studying allowed me to tackle the examination with a solid foundation in the team teaching topics.
